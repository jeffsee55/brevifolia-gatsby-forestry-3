    Hi, this is Terrence Mahon, Co-Founder and Head Coach of Golden Coast Track Club. Thank your for taking the time to visit our new website. We hope you like it.
    The Golden Coast Track Club, newly established in January 2020 is a rebranding of our former team, The Mission Athletics Club. On a day to day level not a lot has changed. We still call San Diego our home, we still have our core group of elite athletes and still have a goal of being successful in both in sport and life.
